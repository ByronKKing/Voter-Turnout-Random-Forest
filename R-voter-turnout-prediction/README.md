#This is an analysis an employer used to test my R skills and basic modeling knowledge. It required me to process a larger voter file, clean it, and try to predict 2014 general election turnout. I include a folder of R scripts that document my EDA practice and my model building process. I ultimately settled on a random forest algorithm to predict turnout.
